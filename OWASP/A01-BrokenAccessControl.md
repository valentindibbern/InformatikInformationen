# Broken Access Control
## Overview:
Maintaining its position at #1 in the Top Ten, 100% of the applications tested were found to have some form of broken access control. Notable CWEs included are CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive
Information to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE-201: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data, CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF). This category has the highest number of occurrences in the contributed data, and second highest number of related CVEs.
## Description:
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside the user's limits. Common access control vulnerabilities include:
- Violation of the principle of least privilege, commonly known as deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool that modifies API requests.
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)
- An accessible API with missing access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
- Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT invalidation.
- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized or untrusted origins.
- Force browsing (guessing URLs) to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.
## How to Prevent:
Access control is only effective when implemented in trusted server-side code or serverless APIs, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.
- Except for public resources, deny by default.
- Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse them throughout the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage.
- Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than allowing users to create, read, update, or delete any record.
- Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
- Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
- Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).
- Implement rate limits on API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
- Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should be short-lived to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker. For longer-lived JWTs, it's highly recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.
- Use well-established toolkits or patterns that provide simple, declarative access controls.
Developers and QA staff should include functional access control in their unit and integration tests.
